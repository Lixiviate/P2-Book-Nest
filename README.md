# BookNest

## Project Description

BookNest is a web application designed to facilitate peer-to-peer book lending. Users can create their own collections of books, share them with others, and borrow books from other users. The application provides a simple and user-friendly way to manage book ownership and borrowing, helping users keep track of their books and interact with fellow book enthusiasts.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure user login and registration with hashed passwords using bcrypt.
- **Book Search:** Users can search for books by title or ISBN using the Open Library API.
- **Add Books to Collection:** Users can add books to their personal collection directly from the search results.
- **Add Books to Wishlist:** Users can add desired books to a wishlist directly from the search results.
- **Safe Sharing Notification:** The app features a banner to remind users to practice safe sharing by meeting in public locations when exchanging books.
- **Borrowing and Returning Books:** Future development.

## Usage

1. **Registration and Login:** Users must register an account or log in to access their book collection and borrowing features.
2. **Search for Books:** Use the search bar to look for books by title or ISBN. The search results are limited to the top 10 results.
3. **Add Books:** Click the "Add Book" button next to a book in the search results to add it to your collection or wishlist.
4. **Borrow and Return Books:** Future development.
5. **Safe Sharing Practices:** Follow on-screen prompts to ensure safe exchanges when meeting others to share books.
